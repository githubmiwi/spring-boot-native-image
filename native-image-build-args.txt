#  arguments to pass to the native-image command

# Builds a statically linked executable, but links the C standard library dynamically. This helps reduce binary size while maintaining compatibility with system-level C libraries
-H:+StaticExecutableWithDynamicLibC

# Disables the fallback mode. If native-image generation fails, it won't produce a JVM-based fallback image. This ensures you're strictly building a native binary.
--no-fallback

# Enforces stricter heap usage rules during image generation. It helps detect memory leaks or misconfigurations in heap usage during build time.
--strict-image-heap

# Tells the compiler to optimize the binary for the host machine's architecture (e.g., using AVX instructions if available). This can improve performance but may reduce portability.
-march=native

# Sets the minimum heap size for the resulting native binary, tested by running the application locally with VM option -Xms.
-R:MinHeapSize=32m

# # Sets the maximum heap size for the resulting native binary, tested by running the application locally with VM option -Xms.
-R:MaxHeapSize=48m

# -O1: Trades performance for reduced file size and build time.
-O1

# Enables aggressive optimization during compilation. This is the highest optimization level and may improve performance, though it can increase build time and binary size.
-O3
